                                    A natural wonder, Balancing Rocks are a set of seemingly delicately balanced eroded volcanic rock formations. Although they look precariously positioned, they have withstood earthquakes of magnitude up to 6.5 on the Richter scale. No wonder that the locals believe these rocks to be as invincible as they are incredible. One rock is balanced on a huge base rock and only touches it slightly. The point of contact between the two rocks is only 6 sq inches. It is believed that it is impossible to disturb the balance of this rock. Many tourists and geologists come to observe and understand the mystery of this place. The area is surrounded by picturesque hillocks and makes for a great natural retreat for visitors. The rocks lie very close to the Madan Mahal Fort in Deotal.

                                <p>As a young child, Hanare was said to be very lonely since she had never known her
                                    family or seen
                                    her own village. She was trained from an early age in the art of espionage. One day,
                                    she was
                                    found crying in a place near her village by the young Kakashi, who spotted her and
                                    carried her
                                    on his back. He then explained to her that she can look up to the clouds above and
                                    find her way.
                                    They both were then seen by a ninja from Hanare's village and Kakashi put her down
                                    on her feet,
                                    said goodbye and left. She was then excited that someone like Kakashi was able to
                                    help her in
                                    her life.

                                    At one point, she met Kakashi Hatake and developed romantic feelings for him.
                                    Hanare, a spy from
                                    Jōmae Village from the Land of Keys, was summoned to infiltrate the Land of Fire and
